## What is Static Analysis?

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFyCZm9jPjlzsAwXS/giphy.gif)
 
----

Static analysis is a method of debugging by automatically examining source code before a program is run.

----

Static analysis is performed early in development, before software testing.

----          

* Early feedback
* Save time

### You can do this with a linter!

----

## What is a linter?

lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs

## How a linter can help us avoid bugs

A linter provides many different types of checks:

----

* Syntax Errors
* Code Standards Adherence
* Potential Problems
* Security Checks

----

You can also create your own custom rules!

----

## Advantages of linting

* Fewer errors in production
* Readable, maintainable and more consistent code
* Fewer discussions about code style and aesthetic choices during code reviews
* Objective measurement of code quality
* More secure and performant code

## What are the pros and cons of unit, integration and end-to-end tests?

### What is the difference between the types?

## Static 
### Errors as you type 
The ingredients 
* flour, eggs, sugar, butter, berries, whipping cream 
* the list can go on!

----

## Unit
### Individual modules in isolation
* Butter and sugar are creamed well
* Meringue is well whipped
* Jam has set

----


## Integration
### Checking different modules work fine when combined

* Making sure the flavours work together
* Making sure the sponge isnt too heavy so it doesnt squash the filling 
* Making sure you have an oven big enough and hot enough to cook your cake

----

## End-to-End 
###  Test whether the flow of an application right from start to finish is behaving as expected

Your finished cake looks and tastes great!

But it doesn't guarentee that everyone will enjoy the cake!

### Money, Time, Confidence

The less code the engineer writes, the less time they use, the less number of faults there could be to solve, the less it will cost?

### Which Testing Types to use in a Project/When to use the different types?

![](https://codeahoy.com/img/blogs/test_pyramid.png)

Google often suggests a 70/20/10 split: 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, and 10% end-to-end tests

----

### Summary


-  Finding bugs in unit testing saves time and reduces overall project costs 
-  Unit tests are easier for others to debug
-  But! they're not enough on their own
-  Integration testing lets you test bugs you didn't/couldn't anticipate on a unit level
-  However it's time consuming- - you have to wait until other modules are done before you can start testing  
-  Can't pinpoint exact source of failure in End to End

| Test Type   | Cost                                          | Time                                                        |
|:----------- |:--------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static      | Cheaper as engineers write less code for this | Short lines of code to write, and fix                       |
| Unit        | Slightly more code than Static                | More code to type, and analysis fixes                       |
| Integration | More code required than Unit                  | Even more code to type, and harder to find where its broken |
| End to End  | SO MUCH CODE to replicate a user/user stories | Trying to fix any errors in this? Set up camp :tent:        |
