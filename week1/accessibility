## Who does semantic HTML benefit?

---

* ##### Search Engines (SEO optimization)
* ##### Users (w/ disabilities)
* ##### Other developers / yourself! 
* ##### :heavy_exclamation_mark:	It is a legal requirement! :heavy_exclamation_mark:

### SEO
Semantic markup helps ensure that valuable content reaches your *target audience* :dart:	
<br>

For example, keywords enclosed in an ***`<h1>`*** tag are given more importance than those enclosed in an ***`<p>`***.

### ACCESSIBILITY

<br>

###### Although the web has grown, it has actually become *less accessible* to the roughly **1 billion** people in the world with disabilities! :open_mouth:

<br>

##### Assistive technologies (that aid disabled users to browse the web) depend on the semantic structure and meaning of web pages to convey information to their users.


---

### MAINTENANCE

> ##### Clear, standardized code, means you’ll save time in the long run :hourglass_flowing_sand:	 

###### It also means that a different developer could come in and work with the code without confusion.

#### How does ARIA relate to HTML?

**ARIA - (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**

* ######  Like semantic HTML, ARIA is a W3 standard that helps make interfaces more accessible to people who use screen readers, browsers and other assistive technologies to consume content.
* ###### When accessibility issues cannot be managed with native HTML, ARIA can help bridge those gaps.

---

##### * ARIA is not supported by all technologies due to the complexities of the standards. :brain: 
##### * Support is found in browsers and assistant technologies(AT) such as screen readers

---

##### ARIA supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. 

##### For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML4, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.

## What's the difference between accessible and inclusive?

---

### Web accessibility  
  
* People with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools.
* **_physical, technical_** ability of web access
* Semantic HTML helps using reading apps, screen readers, smart watches and other assistive devices.

---

### Inclusive  
* providing the best possible experience to the broadest range of users
* concerned not with the logistics of whether everybody **_can_** use it, but whether everybody actually **_wants to_** use it
* Theory of relativity VS Healthy food
* English VS Korean
* Semantic HTML: headings, structure

---

### So what's the difference between accessible and inclusive?

*  While Accessible Design cares only that everyone can hear your message, Inclusive Design asks you to consider your message itself.
*  Semantic HTML is good for both

## How to write semantically?

---

### What does semantic even mean? 

- descriptive
- provides meaning

---

#### Use the right HTML element

- There are about 147 HTML elements and only two of them have no built in accessibility features – ```<div>``` and ```<span>```
- Use ```<div>``` as a last resort :no_good: 

---

- Use heading levels in order - they can be styled later
- Using tags like `<header>` `<footer>` and `<section>` to express intent behind its usage

---

> ##### Semantic elements will allow screen readers to more accurately communicate your content by making the visual audible

### Wrap up

- [x] Better SEO rankings
- [x] Maintainable code
- [x] Easier to style with CSS
- [x] Accessible for disabled/disadvantaged users
- [x] You are future proofing your code
<br>

:zap: You can choose to ignore semantic markup if you want but you will make your job a lot harder!
