## Relational vs non-relational databases

### What's the difference between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases?

---

### How is data structured in a SQL database? my hoa

----

### To the beginning

Database - structured collection of data
 
Database Management System (DBMS) - handles access to structured data, one DBMS can manage multiple databases (like PostgreSQL)

SQL - a standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS)

### Types of Databases

### Relational Databases (RDBMS)

_Traditionally the most popular database to use_

* stores data in tables 
* tables have columns
* each column has a datatype
* each row represents an instance of the table
* tables can relate to other tables

----

### What is NoSQL(“non SQL” or “not only SQL”) 
Non-relational database - doesn't use tables and columns(unstructured)

> NoSQL databases can store relationship data—they just store it differently than relational databases do

----

#### How is Data stored in NoSQL DAtabases
There are four major types of NoSQL databases:
- Document Database 
- Key-Value Database 
- Wide-column Stores 
- Graph database - nodes and edges - social networks

----
 
#### Document Databases
- Store data in documents similar to JSON  objects.
- Schema less and Mostly used for dynamic data 
- Most popular - MongoDB

----

#### Key-Value Database 
- Simplest type of database where each item contains keys and values.
- Huge dataset for simple data

----

#### Wide-Column Databases
- Store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns
- Optimised for reading data in columns instead of rows
- Mostly used for analytics
- most common db is Apache Cassandra

----

#### Graph database 
 - store data in nodes and edges.
- Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.
- Most common db is Neo4j

Simple format

----

Security

----

- Complex queries
- Specific data type (schemas)

---

### Are there disadvantages? 

----

## SUPRISINGLY YES!

----

- In SQL data need to be split between tables. 

- NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.

- For this reason some developers find modeling data relationship to be  challanging in SQL in comparison to NoSQL

----

#### It is all about: Data storage model

----

#### Flexible data models

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriNUHm08iuTga3zG/giphy.gif)

- NoSQL databases typically have very flexible schemas. 
- A **Flexible Schema** === **Simple changes** to your database as requirements change. 
- Faster iteration
- Continuous integration of new application features 
- Provide value to your users faster.

----

#### Horizontal Scaling

- Most SQL databases require you to scale-up vertically
 (migrate to a larger, more expensive server)
 
- Most NoSQL databases allow you to scale-out horizontally
 (you can add cheaper, commodity servers whenever you need to)

----

#### NoSQL can be friendlier for developers
 
  ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/eO6qWndx14SLS/giphy.gif)

- Some NoSQL databases map their data structures. 
- This mapping allows developers to store their data in the same way that they use it in their application code. 
- Developers write less code
- Faster development time 
- Fewer bugs.

----

#### Conclusion

1. Time consuming to understand
2. Time consuming to desing the structure
3. Slower in comapriosn to NoSQL
4. Scalability can be a problem
5. Production speed and debuging
