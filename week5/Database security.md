> SQLi was possibly first documented by Jeff Forristal in the hacker zine Phrack, in 1998. 

<br>

- A type of cybersecurity attack
- Targets databases using specifically crafted SQL statements
- The attacker can then view/modify data that they are not normally able to retrieve

It's been used to steal the personal details of World Health Organization employees, grab data from the Wall Street Journal, and hit the sites of US federal agencies.

### How is this possible?

----

**Most** SQL injections are within the **WHERE** clause of a **SELECT** query

other common places to have SQL injections are: 

**UPDATE** statements within the updated values or the **WHERE** clause
**INSERT** statements within the inserted values
**SELECT** within the table or column name
**SELECT** statements within the **ORDER BY** clause

----

Consider a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts

This causes the application to make an SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

----

The application doesn't implement any defenses against SQL injection attacks, so an attacker can construct an attack like:

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--

Which results in this query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
```

Note the double-dash sequence *- -*
- It makes the rest of the query a comment 
- which removes the remainder of the query, so it no longer includes AND released = 1. 
- This means that all products are displayed, including unreleased products.

----

Typing this in the address bar: 

https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--

Results in the SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
```
The modified query will return all items where either the category is Gifts, or 1 is equal to 1. Since 1=1 is always true, the query will return all items.

### Why is it important for our production databases to have passwords that are kept secret?

- Passwords should be secret :exclamation: 
- Gives others access to our database :warning:

### How can it be used maliciously?

- Access sensitive data.
- Hold data to ransom/sell it.
- Escalate to compromise underlying server or other back-end infrastructure.
- Perform Denial-of-Service attacks.

### How do we guard against it?

- Online tools exist to scan for vulnerabilities at every entry point in your app.
- It works by submitting potentially malicious SQL and monitoring application responses.

* Parameterised queries are essential!

----

### Parameters

* SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.

* Used instead of string concatenation within the query.

* Represented in the SQL statement by a marker.
 
* The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed.

----

#### Parameterized Query 

* Also known as a prepared statement
* ```database.query(parameters, values) ```

```
const text = 'INSERT INTO users(name, email) VALUES($1, $2) RETURNING *'
const values = ['brianc', 'brian.m.carlson@gmail.com']
// callback
client.query(text, values, (err, res) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err.stack)
  } else {
    console.log(res.rows[0])
    // { name: 'brianc', email: 'brian.m.carlson@gmail.com' }
  }
})
```

---
    
```
// promise
client
  .query(text, values)
  .then(res => {
    console.log(res.rows[0])
    // { name: 'brianc', email: 'brian.m.carlson@gmail.com' }
  })
  .catch(e => console.error(e.stack))
```
