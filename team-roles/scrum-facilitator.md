## Project Boards/Kanban

---- 

### Jira - How to use Jira
- Jira is has more comprehensive project boards than github
- Setting it up is a pain but [Hannah's tips](https://dev.to/hannahgooding/group-project-tip-how-to-set-up-a-jira-board-and-link-it-to-your-github-project-2n1d) help.


----

### Jira - Linking your repo to Jira
- Jira links your GitHub commits using project key.
- To make sure your commit messages link to Jira you can use the [cz-conventional-changelog-for-jira](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) npm package

## Labels!!!

- Labels are incredibly useful to convey information about each issue quickly.
- It can also be a huge pain to manually add each label for every new project.

----

#### Dwyl labels

- [Dwyl labels](https://label-sync.herokuapp.com/) is an application that lets you copy labels from one repo to another.
- They have their own repo to take inspo/copy from.
- Select a source repo and a target repo.

<!-- Jennifer -->

## Looking after the team - Daily procedure
- Holding daily stand up
- Creating some guidelines for tool usage

---

### Stand ups:
- 15 minutes to plan the next 24 hours
- Making sure everyone is on the same page
- 3 Qs: 
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - What will you do today?
    - Anything blocking your progress?

---

### Tips for the team
- Keep it snappy
- Keep your answer focussed
- Raise your blockers- don't be shy!

---

### Tips for the facilitator
- Getting too long? Agree a separate time to talk about the issue- that's the point of a stand up
- Get people to actually stand up!
- Have an incentive for attendance... stretch?

---

### Guidelines for tool usage, eg Github & Actions
- Are we going to ensure merges to master can only happen if tests have passed?
- Who will review and close pull requests? Should that person delete the branch and close the project issue too?
- Will we use tmetrics?
